                        DETROIT — When they started building the wall behind
                        Margaret Watson’s house in northwest Detroit, she knew
                        the reason without having to ask.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a child in the late 1930s, Watson had seen the new
                        streets laid down like a tic-tac-toe board in the open
                        fields where her father once planted a garden the size
                        of a city block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She’d roller-skated down those newly paved lanes at
                        speeds that would have been impossible on the dirt roads
                        that ran in front of her house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She knew the new streets had to be for white families —
                        not Black ones like hers — so she wasn’t particularly
                        surprised when, in the spring of 1941, a 6-foot-high,
                        4-inch-thick, half-mile-long concrete fortification
                        suddenly appeared in her backyard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If white people were moving in, she reasoned, they’d
                        need a way to keep her out.

                                said. “Detroit has been segregated all my life.”

                        “I don’t remember feeling any way about it except it was
                        the same old, same old,” said Watson, now 93, who still
                        lives in that house and recalled being excluded from
                        certain restaurants and stores growing up.

                        The wall in Watson’s backyard was built by white real
                        estate developers who struggled to secure financing for
                        their white neighborhood until they cut it off from a
                        Black one. It is one of a number of segregation walls
                        built in the mid-20th century for this purpose and one
                        of a few still standing.

                    <p>
                        The divider — called the “Birwood Wall,” the “Eight Mile
                        Wall” or the “Wailing Wall” — can’t be blamed for
                        inventing segregation. But the barrier, and the policies
                        that led to its existence, would have far-reaching
                        repercussions for the people, both Black and white, who
                        lived in its shadow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the east side, the Black side, some residents were
                        motivated by the wall’s arrival to advocate for change.
                        Others felt penned in by the wall and the racism it
                        represented. While the barricade, which ran through an
                        alley between two residential streets, was not guarded
                        and did not extend across intersections, the towering
                        concrete sent a clear message about who was unwelcome to
                        cross.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the west side, the white side, some children who
                        moved into the houses that sprouted along the new
                        streets in the 1940s — now in their 70s and 80s — say
                        they never knew the wall was there, just as they didn’t
                        know that the houses their parents bought back then had
                        deed restrictions barring residents who weren’t white.
                        They never talked about race with their parents or
                        friends, they said, or wondered why they attended the
                        mostly white MacDowell Elementary School, which enrolled
                        children from the west side of the wall, rather than the
                        mostly Black Higginbotham School, which enrolled
                        children from the east side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Race wasn’t a major issue at the time,” said Stephen
                        Bean, 80, who is white and grew up near the wall.
                        “Everybody just sort of got along.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether people who lived near the wall knew of its
                        existence, they were profoundly shaped by the racist
                        policies and profiteering that built it, according to
                        nearly three dozen interviews with current and former
                        residents of the area and their descendants,
                        conversations with experts and hundreds of pages of land
                        and business records, historical documents and archival
                        materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a six-month investigation, NBC News and BridgeDetroit
                        discovered that one of Detroit’s most prominent families
                        built the wall and developed the adjacent white
                        neighborhood. The reporting also examined the ways this
                        single act of segregation has influenced generations of
                        Detroiters.

                    <p>
                        The side of the wall these residents called home would
                        later affect the sale price of their houses, the value
                        of their next homes, and, eventually, the wealth they
                        might inherit from their parents. Their experience in
                        elementary school would determine the classes they took
                        in high school, their decisions about college or the
                        military, and the ease with which they achieved their
                        goals. And throughout their lives, the friendships they
                        made would frame their interactions with classmates and
                        colleagues, with doctors and law enforcement, in social
                        settings and in job interviews.

                    <h4>This is Detroit's Birwood Wall</h4>
                    <p>
                        It slices through the East Mile-Wyoming neighborhood,
                        just below Eight Mile Road, Detroit's storied northern
                        border.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concrete barrier runs in an alley behind residents'
                        homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The east side was originally a Black neighborhood...
                        while the west side was developed for whites only.

                    <p>
                        Eighty years later, the wall itself, now brightly
                        painted in parts with colorful murals, no longer
                        separates Black from white. The discriminatory policies
                        that made the wall possible have been outlawed. Nearly
                        all of the area’s white residents left for the suburbs
                        decades ago, crossing nearby Eight Mile Road, which
                        separates Detroit from its suburbs and has long
                        symbolized the region’s racial divide. As white families
                        left, they made space for a Black neighborhood of
                        affordable homes to flourish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “This community was such a vibrant community,” said
                        Teresa Moon, 68, who moved to a house just east of the
                        wall in 1959. “We were so well connected, and we had so
                        much love.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the divisions set down in concrete on a spring day
                        in 1941 are an enduring reminder of the reasons this
                        country remains so starkly divided — why a nation that’s
                        more racially and ethnically diverse than almost any
                        other is packed, from coast to coast, with segregated
                        neighborhoods. Parents still send their children to
                        schools that are deeply and persistently divided by race
                        and funded inequitably. Many still face drastically
                        different odds of financial success. Many still view
                        current events — elections, the pandemic, the drumbeat
                        of viral videos that reflect fear and violence and white
                        supremacy in America — through lenses that are blurred
                        or focused by their race.

                    <h4>A 'Real Home'</h4>
                    <p>
                        The story of the Birwood Wall begins at a time when
                        Detroit surged with ambition and wealth, when hundreds
                        of thousands of people were flooding into the city, and
                        when the prospect of decent jobs on the assembly line
                        made it possible for working people to dream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For John and Elizabeth Crews, who arrived in 1918, that
                        dream meant a home — a “REAL HOME,” the Crewses’
                        daughter, Burniece Avery, later wrote in capital letters
                        in a memoir, a home with glass windows, “beautiful
                        curtains, nice furniture.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That home hadn’t been possible in the drafty hut outside
                        of York, Alabama, where John Crews made so little as a
                        sharecropper that he wasn't able to buy shoes for his
                        child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It hadn’t been possible in the coal towns where the
                        family stopped on the journey north, as they joined what
                        became known as the Great Migration of millions of Black
                        families leaving the South. And, at first, it didn’t
                        seem possible in Detroit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though Crews found a job at American Car & Foundry, so
                        many people were arriving in Detroit, which more than
                        tripled in size from 1910 to 1930, that the family
                        struggled to find a decent place to live in the few
                        neighborhoods near downtown that welcomed Black
                        Detroiters. They left one cramped apartment when an
                        unscrupulous landlord repeatedly raised their rent, then
                        lost a house when they couldn’t make monthly payments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s why the Crewses did something audacious: They
                        boarded a streetcar, rode it north beyond the city line,
                        then walked 3 miles on a sandy, shadeless road to reach
                        a rural patch of Greenfield Township, where a relative
                        had tipped them off that an entrepreneur was selling
                        land on contract to Black buyers.

                    <p>
                        There wasn’t much there. The settlement lacked public
                        water and sewers and had no reliable transportation.
                        But, as Avery, who was in grade school at the time in
                        the early 1920s, wrote in her memoir, it offered her
                        parents what they most wanted: “The dream that slowly, a
                        step at a time, they could build a home of their own, on
                        land of their own.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Crewses built a temporary tar-paper shack in the
                        shade of a pear tree, adding to it week by week as each
                        payday bought more lumber and supplies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like many of their neighbors, they built at the back of
                        their lot, leaving the front open for a permanent home
                        later on. But few banks would loan them money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the city of Detroit annexed the area a few years
                        after they arrived, the Crewses hoped that would buoy
                        their prospects. But the people of what Avery called
                        “Shacktown'' weren't the only Detroiters with dreams of
                        homeownership.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The throngs of white families who’d arrived in Detroit
                        in those years were also living in crowded conditions.
                        They were also looking for homes where they could plant
                        gardens and raise children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And as developers laid out plans for the newest parts of
                        Detroit, they had no intention of making room for a half
                        square-mile settlement of Black families in tar-paper
                        shacks.

                    <h4>Blackstone Park No. 6</h4>
                    <p>The vision for this part of Detroit was grand.</p>
                    <p>
                        “The super subdivision with the big future,” crowed an
                        ad that ran in the Detroit Free Press in 1925 over a
                        sketch of elegant homes nestled among shade trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ad for the Blackstone Park No. 6 subdivision
                        promoted low prices, financing and “the restrictions
                        that bring demand for home sites.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those restrictions “almost invariably” included race,
                        said Thomas Sugrue, a New York University historian who
                        wrote a book about race and inequality in Detroit.
                        Living there required white skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the developers’ vision, Blackstone Park No. 6
                        was slow to become a reality. Federal lenders at the
                        time relied on color-coded maps that deemed some
                        neighborhoods safe investments, shading them blue or
                        green, while others were shaded red, meaning
                        “hazardous.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The practice, known as redlining, forced people living
                        in red zones to borrow money at higher interest rates or
                        resort to predatory lenders. It remains a major reason
                        why Black Americans, whose neighborhoods were nearly
                        always shaded red, today have about one-tenth the
                        household wealth of white Americans, Sugrue said. “It
                        deprived generations of African Americans of access to
                        capital to purchase and improve homes.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A 1939 federal housing map clearly shows red ink stamped
                        across the Crewses’ neighborhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This meant the residents of Shacktown couldn’t access
                        federal financing — and neither could the developers of
                        Blackstone Park No. 6.

                        In 1939, many parts of Detroit were redlined — a federal
                        policy that barred lending in areas the government
                        deemed risky.

                    <h4>A ‘humiliating’ barrier</h4>
                    <p>
                        When construction workers began digging a trench between
                        Mendota and Birwood streets in 1941, children came from
                        blocks away to watch, author Gerald Van Dusen wrote in a
                        book about the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They watched for days as crews dug with an excavator,
                        poured cement footings, then stacked concrete bricks
                        until the wall extended the length of three city blocks.
                    </p>
                    <p>“No one knew what to make of it,” Van Dusen wrote.</p>
                    <aside class="pquote">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“CHARGE WALL BUILT TO SEPARATE RACES”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </aside>
                    <p>The wall’s purpose, however, quickly came into focus.</p>
                    <p>
                        “CHARGE WALL BUILT TO SEPARATE RACES” screamed the
                        headline across the front of the July 5, 1941, edition
                        of The Michigan Chronicle, Detroit’s Black newspaper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The paper, which characterized the wall as an effort to
                        establish a “negro ghetto,” detailed a meeting of the
                        city housing commission where a representative for the
                        Blackstone Park development insisted the wall was “being
                        put up simply to improve our subdivision by giving it a
                        fixed border and trim.”
                    </p>
                    <p>The residents of Shacktown didn’t buy that.</p>
                    <p>
                        Avery, who by then had gotten married and built a shack
                        next to her parents, wrote in her memoir that a
                        community group sent emissaries to confront the
                        developer, who refused to take down the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was “humiliating,” Avery wrote.</p>
                    <p>
                        Even more galling was that the new houses on the other
                        side of the wall were getting the very federal housing
                        subsidies she and her neighbors had been trying to get
                        for years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And developers were circling. Avery and her neighbors
                        found a city planning pamphlet that documented poor
                        conditions in their neighborhood and proposed relocating
                        them, replacing their shacks with luxury homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Shall we allow a handful of hapless dreamers to stand
                        in the way of a potential million dollars in taxes which
                        the city could collect annually?” the pamphlet asked,
                        according to Avery.

                        By then, Elizabeth Crews had become a reverend in the
                        African Methodist Episcopal Church and a prominent voice
                        for civil rights. Mother and daughter helped mobilize
                        their community. They sat down to write a letter to
                        President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

                        black?” they wrote, according to Avery’s memoir.

                        early 1940s.

                    <p>
                        Now 81, he remembers foraging in the construction sites
                        near his house for bits of wood he could use to build
                        forts. He remembers the swingset and teeter-totter his
                        father, an accountant who worked for the Michigan
                        Consolidated gas company, built on an adjacent lot,
                        which made his street a gathering place for neighborhood
                        kids.

                    <p>
                        He doesn’t remember thinking about race. He’s white. His
                        friends were white. He never wondered why there were few
                        Black faces in the halls of his elementary school.

                    <p>
                        And he never knew that the house where he spent the
                        first decade of his life had a line in its deed that
                        barred occupancy “by any persons not of pure, unmixed,
                        white Caucasian race,” according to land records
                        obtained by NBC News and BridgeDetroit.

                        “Presumably my parents would have known about it, but
                        generally it would not have been something that would
                        have been discussed,” he said.

                        Beals never gave much thought to whether his life was

                        His family left Detroit for the suburbs in 1951. He went
                        on to get an engineering degree from the University of
                        Michigan, moved to Maryland to work for IBM, then

                        When the civil rights movement was grabbing headlines in
                        the 1960s, he was focused on work and his young family
                        and didn’t think the conversation had anything to do
                        with him, he said, just as he’s watched the Black Lives

                        On the east side of the wall, however, discussions of
                        race were unavoidable, particularly in the 1940s when a
                        surging Black population intensified the city’s housing
                        shortage, stoking racial animosity. A white mob tried to
                        stop Black residents from moving into a housing project
                        on the city’s east side. White factory workers staged
                        strikes to protest integration, and violent clashes
                        between Black and white residents during a 1943 race
                        riot left 34 people dead, including 17 Black people
                        killed by police.

                    <h4>The men who built the wall</h4>
                    <p>
                        The question of who built the Birwood Wall has long been
                        shrouded in mystery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Van Dusen, whose book about the wall was published in
                        2019, said he wasn’t interested in assigning blame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Then you would reduce it to a moment in time, a
                        particular person,” rather than a system of racist
                        policies, he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The researchers who documented the wall’s history
                        recently in the state’s application for the National
                        Register of Historic Places also weren’t sure who built
                        it. They spotted a name — James T. McMillan — in the
                        1941 Michigan Chronicle story about the wall’s
                        construction and speculated that it “may have been the
                        James T. McMillan who was the president of the Detroit
                        and Cleveland Navigation Company.” But they couldn’t
                        confirm it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That James T. McMillan was a member of one of Detroit's
                        wealthiest and most prominent families. His grandfather,
                        James McMillan, represented Michigan as a U.S. senator
                        from 1890 until his death in 1902.

                    <p>
                        Today, members of the McMillan family are community
                        leaders in Detroit and across the country, serving on
                        corporate and nonprofit boards. No one has publicly
                        suggested that the family had anything to do with the
                        now-infamous wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When NBC News and BridgeDetroit reached out to Francis
                        W. McMillan II, one of James T. McMillan’s grandsons and
                        a member of the Detroit Historical Society board, he
                        said he’d never heard of the wall or any family
                        connection to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b
                            >“It’s ancient history, dear,” he told a reporter
                            during that call. “Why are you digging around in
                            something that is maybe nothing at all?”
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The grandson, 83, who is known as Sandy, said his family
                        had invested in banking, railroads and other industries
                        — not in real estate — and he raised concerns that
                        unproven accusations could harm his forebears’
                        reputation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “They did a whole bunch of really great things for
                        Michigan,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon afterward, NBC News and BridgeDetroit confirmed his
                        grandfather’s ties to the wall. Business records
                        obtained from state archives for the Nottingham Land
                        Company, which developed Blackstone Park No. 6, listed
                        home addresses for members of the McMillan family —
                        James T. McMillan and his two sons — that match
                        addresses for the family listed in newspaper articles.
                        One of the sons was Sandy McMillan’s father.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “As you can imagine, I’m shocked and this is difficult
                        for me to hear,” Sandy McMillan wrote in an email after
                        reviewing the records. “I see that this is an important
                        story that needs to be told.”
                    </p>
                    <p>He declined to comment further.</p>
                    <p>
                        Sandy McMillan said in the initial call that he didn’t
                        think his grandfather was racist. James T. McMillan, who
                        died in 1946, had not created the policies that made it
                        harder to finance housing near redlined neighborhoods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, as a self-described “history guy,” Sandy McMillan
                        added that he hoped an examination of the wall’s
                        construction could be instructive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With history, he said, “you learn from the good things
                        and the not so good things, and you don’t hide either of
                        them.”
                    </p>
                    <h4>‘Immeasurable’ consequences</h4>
                    <p>
                        White families didn’t last long in Blackstone Park No.
                        6.

                    <p>
                        Members of the neighborhood association vigorously
                        defended the racial rules in their deeds for several
                        years, even taking steps in 1944 to expel a Chinese war
                        refugee who moved in with her children, according to
                        newspaper articles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But in 1948, the Supreme Court made it illegal to
                        enforce racial deed restrictions, and by the following
                        year, a row of houses intended for Black buyers had
                        sprung up on Mendota, the street just west of the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1953, Mary Binion Terry and her 10 siblings were
                        among the first Black children to move onto nearby Manor
                        Street, she said.

                    <p>
                        Now 82, she remembers watching from her front yard as a
                        pair of white real estate agents worked her block,
                        encouraging white residents to sell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “They were selling like hotcakes,” she said. “Every day,
                        for weeks, there would be people moving out and Black
                        people moving in.”

                    <aside class="pquote">
                        <blockquote>

                    <p>
                        When she and her siblings enrolled in the local
                        elementary school, they were among the first Black
                        students there. Teachers gave them a second intelligence
                        test because they thought their first scores were too
                        high for Black children, she said.

                    <p>
                        But within a few years, Black families were the
                        majority. Two Black neighborhoods — one built by Black
                        activism, the other by white flight — became a single
                        community, known as Eight Mile-Wyoming, with a wall in
                        the middle.

                        Jeffrey Edison, 70, whose family moved to the
                        neighborhood in the early 1950s, said everything he and
                        his friends needed was in the neighborhood. The watchful
                        eyes of family friends like the Binions meant they
                        couldn’t make trouble without someone telling their
                        parents.

                        Families in this part of Detroit sang in the choir,
                        prayed together and sent their children to Sunday school
                        at churches like Oak Grove African Methodist Episcopal
                        Church, which was co-founded by the Crews family.
                        Lifelong friendships took root at the Johnson Recreation
                        Center, which became a gathering place for neighborhood
                        children, including a Boy Scouts troop. It had a pool —
                        rare for Black neighborhoods at the time.

                        The neighborhood, where well-built houses had front and
                        back yards, new sidewalks and space to ride bikes,
                        offered Black Detroiters a lifestyle that wasn’t
                        available in the overcrowded neighborhoods near
                        downtown, said Herb Boyd, who grew up in the
                        neighborhood and wrote “Black Detroit: A People’s
                        History of Self-Determination.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the time they got to high school in the 1960s, the
                        area’s Black children were aware of the deep racial
                        divisions outside of their community. Inspired by
                        demonstrations nationwide, students at Mumford High
                        School formed a Black Student Union and staged sit-ins
                        and walkouts, challenging the school’s curriculum and
                        pushing for more Black teachers, Edison said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We as students wanted more say,” said Edison, an
                        instinct that guided him as he went to Howard
                        University, a historically Black college, and as he
                        returned to Detroit to become a defense attorney.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But while the mass departure of the city’s white
                        population helped shape strong Black neighborhoods like
                        Eight Mile-Wyoming, the economic consequences for
                        Detroit were devastating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Few of the white former Blackstone Park No. 6 residents
                        interviewed recently said they’d thought about how their
                        family’s decision to leave drove up home prices in the
                        suburbs, such as Farmington Hills, where the average
                        home now sells for $318,000, according to Zillow, while
                        driving them down in the city, where the average house
                        now sells for $51,000. Most said they hadn’t considered
                        that this might still be a factor in the economic
                        differences between their families and the ones who
                        moved into their former homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When asked why their family moved to the suburbs, none
                        of these white former residents mentioned race. They
                        talked about bigger houses or a desire to be closer to
                        friends and relatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But race was very much a part of the federal and city
                        policies that supported white neighborhoods with home
                        financing and destroyed Black ones in the name of “urban
                        renewal,” said Jacob Faber, an associate professor of
                        sociology and public service at New York University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 1950s, as white Detroiters began to move to the
                        suburbs, some leaders of those communities made it clear
                        Blacks weren’t welcome. In Detroit, Mayor Albert Cobo,
                        who ran for office promising to stem a “Negro invasion,”
                        demolished historic Black neighborhoods, building
                        freeways and mixed-income housing developments that
                        displaced Black residents. He then blocked proposed
                        federal housing projects intended for Black families
                        that he thought were too close to white neighborhoods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Efforts like these not only segregated Detroit — they
                        kept it that way, Faber said. He pointed to his study
                        showing that cities redlined by the federal government
                        are far more segregated today than cities that weren't.

                        The protective bubble that surrounded Teresa Moon during
                        her childhood just east of the wall began to dissolve
                        when she was in high school.

                    <p>
                        Her parents never told her why the wall she could see
                        from her family’s modest yellow brick house was built.
                        When she joined the first class of an integrated middle
                        school in 1966, she didn’t know that her new
                        relationships with white peers would be fleeting.

                        But Detroit was changing. An uprising in 1967 — five
                        days of clashes between Black residents and police, in
                        which 43 people were killed, most of them by police or
                        the National Guard, and hundreds of buildings were
                        destroyed — became a visible display of racial strife in
                        America. By the time Moon graduated from Mumford High
                        School in 1970, most of the white classmates she’d
                        started with were gone.

                    <p>
                        A city once flush with promise saw its tax base crater
                        as the population plunged. Factories were closing.
                        Detroit’s Big Three automakers started automating and
                        moving jobs overseas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There was a lot of inequality in everything,” Moon
                        said. “It wasn’t just the redlining to live in a certain
                        area. It was our inability to accumulate generational
                        wealth. It was our education, everything.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moon went to work for the city in 1979 as a dental
                        assistant in the health department, when Detroit’s first
                        Black mayor, Coleman A. Young, made a point of putting
                        residents to work. She’d inherited her parents’ house on
                        Griggs Street, where she’d always felt at home, but she
                        began to worry about drugs and crime. She recalled the
                        man she saw shot in front of her house in the 1970s and
                        the sound of gunfire shattering the peace through the
                        1980s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “People became more to themselves,” she said. They no
                        longer showed up with shovels on snow days to clear
                        their neighbors’ walks.

                        She hesitated before sending her son, born in 1981, to
                        the park across from her house, where the grass was
                        overgrown and weedy. “It was messed up over there,” she
                        said.

                        She never considered leaving the neighborhood she loves,
                        but many of the people she grew up with were heading
                        out. The Black middle class began moving in high numbers
                        in the last decades of the 20th century, following the
                        same path to the suburbs their white neighbors had taken
                        years earlier. That further ravaged the city’s tax base
                        and crippled services, especially in the years leading
                        up to 2013, when Detroit declared the largest municipal
                        bankruptcy in U.S. history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Detroit’s exit from bankruptcy has been heralded as a
                        turnaround, enabling a troubled city to get out from
                        under debilitating debt. But retired city employees like
                        Moon saw their pensions and health care slashed.
                        Residents of Eight Mile-Wyoming complain that the city’s
                        revival has been too focused on downtown, where
                        restaurants and condos now cater to the white children
                        and grandchildren of the people who left long ago.

                        And while this neighborhood of well-built homes has
                        fared better than other parts of Detroit, the mortgage
                        crisis, followed by a foreclosure crisis, has taken a
                        toll. A city once known as a bastion of homeownership
                        now has more renters than owners.

                        Watson, who inherited her parents’ house on Birwood
                        Street and lives there today, laments that her
                        neighborhood lacks the recreation centers and schools
                        that once made it a haven for families.

                        “The kids don’t have anything to do, and I don’t have
                        anything to do,” she said. “They’re tearing up my
                        neighborhood.”
                    </p>
                    <h4>‘It’s important that people know’</h4>
                    <p>
                        Over the last 80 years, the Birwood Wall has come to
                        mean different things to different people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Avery was angered by it, said her granddaughter, Rose
                        McKinney-James.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “She resented those who were behind the decision to
                        create it,” McKinney-James said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Avery, who went to college late in life and became
                        an educator, also understood the wall’s power to teach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Avery raised McKinney-James and her brothers in a large
                        house in Boston-Edison, a historic Detroit neighborhood
                        where the family moved in the 1950s. But Avery always
                        brought her grandchildren back to the old neighborhood
                        for church on Sunday and often pointed out the wall,
                        McKinney-James said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There were frequent conversations about the history of
                        the wall and what it meant to the development of the
                        community,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        McKinney-James, 69, sees the wall as a “catalyst” for
                        her own success, a symbol that inspired her to go to law
                        school, to work in Washington for the first Black woman
                        elected to Congress, and to eventually become a
                        government and business leader in Nevada.

                    <p>
                        The wall, which a local artist painted with murals in
                        2006, still serves an educational role, said Moon, who
                        often sees tour groups pulling up and makes a point of
                        greeting them.

                    <p>
                        The visitors are mostly white and “very liberal,” she
                        said. “I’ve seen people out there crying about it and
                        telling me how sorry they are that it was ever done.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The wall today does the opposite of what it was designed
                        to do, Moon said. It brings people together.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An annual cookout on the second Saturday in August has
                        brought generations of Detroiters back to the
                        neighborhood for the last 30 years. Most of them are
                        Black, but some white friends and neighbors come, too.
                        The event T-shirt for a recent gathering featured a
                        picture of the wall. A neighborhood group distributed
                        bracelets that said “Eight Mile For Life.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon, visitors will see a plaque recounting the wall’s
                        story and marking it as on the National Register of
                        Historic Places. But Moon, who tends the flowers in the
                        park in front of the wall, still plans to greet
                        visitors.

                        “I want them to know not just the logistics of the
                        wall,” she said. “It’s important that people know about
                        my community.”
