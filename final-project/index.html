                        DETROIT — When they started building the wall behind
                        Margaret Watson’s house in northwest Detroit, she knew
                        the reason without having to ask.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a child in the late 1930s, Watson had seen the new
                        streets laid down like a tic-tac-toe board in the open
                        fields where her father once planted a garden the size
                        of a city block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She’d roller-skated down those newly paved lanes at
                        speeds that would have been impossible on the dirt roads
                        that ran in front of her house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She knew the new streets had to be for white families —
                        not Black ones like hers — so she wasn’t particularly
                        surprised when, in the spring of 1941, a 6-foot-high,
                        4-inch-thick, half-mile-long concrete fortification
                        suddenly appeared in her backyard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If white people were moving in, she reasoned, they’d
                        need a way to keep her out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I don’t remember feeling any way about it except it was
                        the same old, same old,” said Watson, now 93, who still
                        lives in that house and recalled being excluded from
                        certain restaurants and stores growing up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I mean, I lived in Detroit all my life,” Watson said.
                        “Detroit has been segregated all my life.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The wall in Watson’s backyard was built by white real
                        estate developers who struggled to secure financing for
                        their white neighborhood until they cut it off from a
                        Black one. It is one of a number of segregation walls
                        built in the mid-20th century for this purpose and one
                        of a few still standing.
