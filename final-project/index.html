                        DETROIT — When they started building the wall behind
                        Margaret Watson’s house in northwest Detroit, she knew
                        the reason without having to ask.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a child in the late 1930s, Watson had seen the new
                        streets laid down like a tic-tac-toe board in the open
                        fields where her father once planted a garden the size
                        of a city block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She’d roller-skated down those newly paved lanes at
                        speeds that would have been impossible on the dirt roads
                        that ran in front of her house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She knew the new streets had to be for white families —
                        not Black ones like hers — so she wasn’t particularly
                        surprised when, in the spring of 1941, a 6-foot-high,
                        4-inch-thick, half-mile-long concrete fortification
                        suddenly appeared in her backyard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If white people were moving in, she reasoned, they’d
                        need a way to keep her out.

                                said. “Detroit has been segregated all my life.”

                        “I don’t remember feeling any way about it except it was
                        the same old, same old,” said Watson, now 93, who still
                        lives in that house and recalled being excluded from
                        certain restaurants and stores growing up.

                        The wall in Watson’s backyard was built by white real
                        estate developers who struggled to secure financing for
                        their white neighborhood until they cut it off from a
                        Black one. It is one of a number of segregation walls
                        built in the mid-20th century for this purpose and one
                        of a few still standing.

                        The divider — called the “Birwood Wall,” the “Eight Mile
                        Wall” or the “Wailing Wall” — can’t be blamed for
                        inventing segregation. But the barrier, and the policies
                        that led to its existence, would have far-reaching
                        repercussions for the people, both Black and white, who
                        lived in its shadow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the east side, the Black side, some residents were
                        motivated by the wall’s arrival to advocate for change.
                        Others felt penned in by the wall and the racism it
                        represented. While the barricade, which ran through an
                        alley between two residential streets, was not guarded
                        and did not extend across intersections, the towering
                        concrete sent a clear message about who was unwelcome to
                        cross.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the west side, the white side, some children who
                        moved into the houses that sprouted along the new
                        streets in the 1940s — now in their 70s and 80s — say
                        they never knew the wall was there, just as they didn’t
                        know that the houses their parents bought back then had
                        deed restrictions barring residents who weren’t white.
                        They never talked about race with their parents or
                        friends, they said, or wondered why they attended the
                        mostly white MacDowell Elementary School, which enrolled
                        children from the west side of the wall, rather than the
                        mostly Black Higginbotham School, which enrolled
                        children from the east side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Race wasn’t a major issue at the time,” said Stephen
                        Bean, 80, who is white and grew up near the wall.
                        “Everybody just sort of got along.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether people who lived near the wall knew of its
                        existence, they were profoundly shaped by the racist
                        policies and profiteering that built it, according to
                        nearly three dozen interviews with current and former
                        residents of the area and their descendants,
                        conversations with experts and hundreds of pages of land
                        and business records, historical documents and archival
                        materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a six-month investigation, NBC News and BridgeDetroit
                        discovered that one of Detroit’s most prominent families
                        built the wall and developed the adjacent white
                        neighborhood. The reporting also examined the ways this
                        single act of segregation has influenced generations of
                        Detroiters.

                    <p>
                        The side of the wall these residents called home would
                        later affect the sale price of their houses, the value
                        of their next homes, and, eventually, the wealth they
                        might inherit from their parents. Their experience in
                        elementary school would determine the classes they took
                        in high school, their decisions about college or the
                        military, and the ease with which they achieved their
                        goals. And throughout their lives, the friendships they
                        made would frame their interactions with classmates and
                        colleagues, with doctors and law enforcement, in social
                        settings and in job interviews.

                    <h4>This is Detroit's Birwood Wall</h4>
                    <p>
                        It slices through the East Mile-Wyoming neighborhood,
                        just below Eight Mile Road, Detroit's storied northern
                        border.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concrete barrier runs in an alley behind residents'
                        homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The east side was originally a Black neighborhood...
                        while the west side was developed for whites only.
                    </p>

                            consequences of racist policies.</b

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eighty years later, the wall itself, now brightly
                        painted in parts with colorful murals, no longer
                        separates Black from white. The discriminatory policies
                        that made the wall possible have been outlawed. Nearly
                        all of the area’s white residents left for the suburbs
                        decades ago, crossing nearby Eight Mile Road, which
                        separates Detroit from its suburbs and has long
                        symbolized the region’s racial divide. As white families
                        left, they made space for a Black neighborhood of
                        affordable homes to flourish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “This community was such a vibrant community,” said
                        Teresa Moon, 68, who moved to a house just east of the
                        wall in 1959. “We were so well connected, and we had so
                        much love.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the divisions set down in concrete on a spring day
                        in 1941 are an enduring reminder of the reasons this
                        country remains so starkly divided — why a nation that’s
                        more racially and ethnically diverse than almost any
                        other is packed, from coast to coast, with segregated
                        neighborhoods. Parents still send their children to
                        schools that are deeply and persistently divided by race
                        and funded inequitably. Many still face drastically
                        different odds of financial success. Many still view
                        current events — elections, the pandemic, the drumbeat
                        of viral videos that reflect fear and violence and white
                        supremacy in America — through lenses that are blurred
                        or focused by their race.

                    <p>The story of the Birwood Wall begins at a time when Detroit surged with ambition and wealth, when hundreds of thousands of people were flooding into the city, and when the prospect of decent jobs on the assembly line made it possible for working people to dream. </p>
                    <p>For John and Elizabeth Crews, who arrived in 1918, that dream meant a home — a “REAL HOME,” the Crewses’ daughter, Burniece Avery, later wrote in capital letters in a memoir, a home with glass windows, “beautiful curtains, nice furniture.” </p>
                    <p>That home hadn’t been possible in the drafty hut outside of York, Alabama, where John Crews made so little as a sharecropper that he wasn't able to buy shoes for his child.</p>
